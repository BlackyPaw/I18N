# I18N
Internationalization API for use with CraftBukkit / Spigot

The I18N project aims to be an easy-to-use API for plugin developers to internationalize their plugins.
I18N takes away a lot of the repetitive and tedious work that must be done in order to have the right
translations in place and exposes a simple but powerful API that blends into the official Bukkit / Spigot
API nicely.

## Getting Started
